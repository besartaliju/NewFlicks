# Project 1 - Flicks

Flicks is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: 11 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [XX] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
- [XX] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
- [XX] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API.
- [XX] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [XX] User sees an error message when there's a networking error.
- [ ] Movies are displayed using a CollectionView instead of a TableView.
- [XX] User can search for a movie.
- [ ] All images fade in as they are loading.
- [XX] Customize the UI.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] User can tap anywhere on the screen to cancel searching

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Using a collection view rather than a table view and whether or not that is very important. 
2. How to make this app very user friendly.
3. How to update the images for each movie when you search for the name.

## Notes

Knowing how to phrase questions for Google and Stack Overflow was a bit of a challenge.
Trying to figure out how to test for network availability without using a 3rd party library and UIAlertController was confusing.

# Project 2 - *Flicks 2.0*

**Flicks** is a movies app displaying box office and top rental DVDs using [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: 13 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] User can view movie details by tapping on a cell.
- [X] User can select from a tab bar for either **Now Playing** or **Top Rated** movies.
- [X] Customize the selection effect of the cell.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] For the large poster, load the low resolution image first and then switch to the high resolution image when complete.
- [X] Customize the navigation bar.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- Didn't improve app functionality so much as I designed a new UI with specific color schemes inspired by a very old Adidas sweater that had a very monochromatic look. I thought that would've looked good for movies since they started in black and white, which as a result, has some sort of grey in it.
